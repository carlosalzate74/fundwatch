## Overview

How often have you asked yourself: “Where did my money go?”. Some days we spend thousands on basic expenses like rent or mortgage, other days we spend twenty dollars for a lunch meal, and there are days when we spend on absolutely nothing. Manually keeping track of all these expenses are time consuming and not sustainable. The challenge is to automate this process by creating an expense tracker web app - FundWatch. 

Manual tracking is severely limiting your ability to budget. There are numerous apps available in the market but they can be complicated, hard to use, or have too many features. Our goal is to create something simple yet functional and will help you create financial awareness and help identify spending issues.

## Scope

FundWatch does not link to any bank accounts and is solely a tool to track personal expenses.

## Deployment

FundWatch is currently deployed on Heroku.
